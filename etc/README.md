# Configuration files

Herein lies configuration files. Some are used actively and some are very stale indeed.

## General
My editor of choice is [vim](https://www.vim.org/). My [vim configuration](vim/vimrc) is the basis
for many of the key-strokes that I setup for various programs. I don't use the modern neovim (yet)
because I use the completion plugin [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe).

## Important files
This is (not an exhaustive) list of configuration files that I use daily:
* [vimrc](vim/vimrc): with [a bunch of sub-scripts](vim/plugins/this_self)
* [zshrc](zsh/zshrc): my favorite shell is [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/); [sub-scripts](zsh/conf.d)
* [tmux.conf](tmux/tmux.conf): I use C-f as prefix key and setup various copy/paste mechanisms
